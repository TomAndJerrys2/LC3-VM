# LC3 Virtual Machine

a Quick project to understand virtual machine implementations and how we can interact
with hardware components on a higher level abstraction. This isn't supposed to be good
or robust in anyway, though - I'll probably end up making one a lot better and for more 
standardized, modern architectures like x86 and ARM
